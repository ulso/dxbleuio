# Example Dioxus/Rust application monitoring sensor devices using the BleuIO dongle

Your new bare-bones project includes minimal organization with a single `main.rs` file and a few assets.

```
project/
├─ assets/ # Any assets that are used by the app should be placed here
├─ src/
│  ├─ main.rs # main.rs is the entry point to your application and currently contains all components for the app 
│  ├─ bleuio.rs # bleuio.rs contains some enums and utility functions for BleuIO access
├─ Cargo.toml # The Cargo.toml file defines the dependencies and feature flags for your project
```

Run the following command in the root of your project to start developing with the default platform:

```bash
dx run
```
