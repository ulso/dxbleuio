# Example Dioxus/Rust application monitoring sensor devices using the [BleuIO](https://bleuio.com) dongle

This is my first try to develop a desktop application in Rust using the [Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com) framework.

The kinds of sensor that could be monitored by this application are the ones from [Smart Sensor Devices AB](https://smartsensordevices.com), specifically the [HibouAIR](https://smartsensordevices.com/our-products-and-solutions/) sensors.
